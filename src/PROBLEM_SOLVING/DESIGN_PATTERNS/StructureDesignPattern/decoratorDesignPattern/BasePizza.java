/*
 * If we don't use the design pattern then below can be the architecture
 * - Base Pizza Abstract Class: With one abstract method cost
 *   > VegDelight
 *   > NonVegDelight
 * - Mushroom Pizza will extend the BasePizza and mention the new cost and same for all types of pizza.
 * - With this Approach we will end up with class explosion. Where we have n number of classes with just one functionality.
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Solution: Implementing Decorator Design Pattern
 * - BasePizza: we have two base pizzas below
 *   > VegDelight
 *   > NonVegDelight
 * - ToppingDecorator or FeatureDecorator: which will be abstract and maintain has-a and is-a relationship with base pizza.
 *   > ToppingDecorator will extend the base pizza (is-a) and keep a base pizza (has-a) variable as well.
 * - MushroomPizza: Extends ToppingDecorator and maintain is-a relationship. And also keeping an object of base pizza and maintaining has-a with base pizza.
